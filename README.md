## How to get create a list of apps to remove

To use the script you'll need to make a text file with a list of the apps to remove.

To get a list of all the apps, use this command in an elevated PowerShell session:

``` powershell
Get-AppxProvisionedPackage -Online | Select DisplayName
```

To get a list of built-in apps for the current user:

``` powershell
Get-AppxPackage | Select Name
```

## How to find the index number of the image in the wim file

Run the following command to find out what images are present in the wim file:

``` powershell
Get-WindowsImage -ImagePath "C:\foo\Windows 10\sources\install.wim" | Format-Table -Property ImageIndex, ImageName
```

Here is a table of apps names in PowerShell and what they relate to in Windows. You can use this table to create your own removal list.
